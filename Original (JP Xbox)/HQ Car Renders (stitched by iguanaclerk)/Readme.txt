Missing, since they're C2C exclusive:  550 barchetta, superamerica, F430. spr_SPRANI_SUMO_VSLOAD_Exst probably has the highest quality for them.

I present, as a resource, the car selection renders from the original Chihiro version and Xbox port. They are cut up into different sprite pages in the texture files, so this will be easier to handle.
As these filled the screen in those versions, they are higher quality than what's otherwise available (and all at a consistent level of quality). These are the 12 cars from the Xbox port (SP2 + two more) with all their available colors. The original eight cars from Outrun 2 with the original 4 colors use uncompressed textures and look exceptional.

For any HD recreations these will be suitable for the arcade selection screen and with some outlining/dropshadow can be used for the Ghost icons. (Interestingly, the game uses the outlined/dropshadowed sprites for the SP2 Ghosts, but non-outlined/dropshadowed ones for the home port exclusive cars). The C2C online selection sprites have three more cars and the additional class skins, so those will be best sourced from the online loading sprite sheets in C2C.

These have a number of small fixes from the original sprites:
F355 Spider: Dropshadow fixed
Dino 246GTS: Red highlight recolored to match the rest of the car for non-red colors.
Overlaid the available hi-res renders for the red 250GTO to reduce compression artifacts. Manually did touch-up on the the Testarossa to accomplish the same thing.

The F355 Spider has all 8 colors available in C2C, but I think some are unused in the Xbox port and the sprites for some color variants look unfinished. I've included all of them to be comprehensive. These Chihiro textures had a more blue-colored dropshadow, so I've used the Xbox dropshadow for consistency (the original sprites are also included).

Included are both versions of the Testarossa sprite. The first was used for the original arcade version and was modeled off the official "Testarossa Spider" convertible (only one ever produced). Eventually, during production of SP2, they switched to making it look like the Testarossa convertible's appearance in Outrun 1 (which just carves the top off of a normal Testarossa).
