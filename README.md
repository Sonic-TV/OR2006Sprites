# OR2006Sprites - Contributions are welcome!

A repository hosting all sprites that have been ripped from the various Outrun 2[006] versions, as well as any HD UI remakes and texture mods. Asset replacements are intended to be used with [OutRun2006 Tweaks.](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/)

# Official Media Kit Assets
Contains some HQ cars, logos, and various other images of note.

# Original _____
Contains texture dumps from different versions of Outrun 2. The PC folder contains a separate subfolder for [or2tool](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/90) alongside Tweaks' own internal texture dump folder. Since Tweaks only dumps what is loaded by the game, or2tool is included here to catch any unused files (such as alternate girlfriend colors).

# PSDs
Contains any PSD files that were shared.

# Remake
Contains HD asset remakes and miscellanious retexture mods. Note that WIP contains placeholder AI upscale assets, so use those at your own risk or wait until they're complete. The UI folder should be ready to drop into your `textures/load` folder (if they're in subfolders, make sure you move the folders inside to `textures/load`.

## Textures/Sprites

### [UI](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/)

Before you download any HD sprite remakes, grab the [Higher Quality UI Sprites pack](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20#issuecomment-2248548840) and the Font Fix pack in that same post. Then, grab the [uncensored Clarissa HQ sprite pack.](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20#issuecomment-2231328011)

#### [Album Covers](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Album%20Covers/)
Contains HD remakes of the music albums.

#### [Controller Prompts](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Button%20Prompts)
Contains various replacement textures for the keyboard prompt icons.

#### [Font](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Font)
Contains HD versions of the various menu fonts.

#### [Menus](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Menus)
Contains HD versions of the various menu sprites.

#### [Tachometer](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Tachometers)
Contains HD versions of the car tachometers.


### [Girlfriends](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Girlfriends/)

#### Clarissa Holly - Sprite Fix - Lindbergh Sprites Uncensored (v9 by iguanaclerk)
Contains HQ sprites sourced and cleaned up from the Lindbergh version. Make sure you grab these.

#### Clarissa & Holly Alternate Passenger Colors (Redhead and Brunette respectively)
Lets you swap out the hair and outfit colors for these two with their unused (rival?) girlfriend versions.

### [Levels](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/)


####  [Billboards](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Billboards/) 
In this folder, you'll find two subfolders. **Invisible Billboards**, for if you want to completely remove the billboards altogether, and **SEGA Billboards (Habanero)** (WIP) for some fan-made SEGA billboards. You can leave **Invisible Billboards** in the `/load/` folder, since the game reuses the same billboards for multiple levels. **SEGA Billboards** was designed with giving each billboard a unique image, so you should put those in the respective folder of the level whose billboard you want to replace. You can download a dump of all the billboards sorted into their level folders [here](https://github.com/ksdomino/or2billboards/releases), with a level folder name table included.

####  [Checkpoint Flags](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Checkpoint%20Flag%20Remake/) 

####  [Goal Flags](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Goal%20Flags%20Remake/) 

####  [Highway Bunki Signs](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Highway%20Signs%20Remake/) 
Contains a remake of the green highway signs, and the associated stage icon. The signs use Road Geek as the imitation font.

#### [Invisible Road Signs](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Invisible%20Road%20Signs/) 
In this folder, you'll find a texture replacement zip that makes all road signs invisible. Aside from reducing visual clutter and making the stages look nicer, this also provides a bit of extra challenge so you have to memorize the stage rather than using the road signs as a crutch.

#### [Skyboxes](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Skyboxes/) 
WIP. Contains new skybox tiles generated in Stable Diffusion 1.5, to replace the often-times super compressed, low quality skyboxes that come with the game.

#### [Sunny Beach buoy (SASRT)](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Sunny%20Beach%20buoy%20(SASRT)/) 
Replaces the beach buoy arrow on Sunny Beach with an identical, higher quality one from the Outrun Bay level, from Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed.

### [Car Skins and Details](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Car%20Skins%20and%20Details/)

#### [Car Detail Remakes](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Car%20Detail%20Remakes/)
Contains remakes of the textures that appear on/in player cars.

#### [Car Reskins](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Car%20Detail%20Reskins/)
Contains alternate liveries for cars. Note that all cars share from the same handful of textures, so you can only really edit the color of two or three cars and have it look good. It is recommended that you pick on car and design/use liveries around that one.

#### [License Plates](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/License%20Plates/)

# Misc. Recommended Mods

## [Looping FLAC soundtrack](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20#issuecomment-2273911728)
Tweaks supports flac and LOOP tags, so this upload by Danhanado adds loop tags to the source music. Driver's Megamix and 1984 Magical Sound Shower are also included in the post, and a new Titlescreen.bik with HQ audio is in the download.

## [Louder Engine Sound](https://github.com/ksdomino/OR2LouderEngineSound/releases)
The best thing about Outrun is the Music!
This mod fixes a bug in the original game where the road effects were too loud compared to the music and Ferrari engine.
This release lowers the volume of the other sound Effects (especially the road effects) by 50% so the engine sounds louder.
You'll still have he option to turn the music down or sound effects down to create a balance that you like and then turn up the overall volume on your headphones.

EDIT: This mod doesn't make it harder to hear Outrun's amazing music, it actually make it clearer because it fixes a problem in the original release where all road effects are stored in the same .pak file as the engine making everything the same volume! This mod fixes that oversight.

## [SEGA Jingle (flac)](https://files.catbox.moe/t3qja5.flac)
Rename to sega441.flac, put it in the Sound folder.

## [2SP Titlescreen Remake](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20#issuecomment-2328433846)
A new titlescreen that mimics the 2SP arcade intro, completely remade in 4k by Sonic-TV.

## [Outrun 2 Titlescreen Remake](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20#issuecomment-2746363307)
A new titlescreen remake by iguanaclerk.
