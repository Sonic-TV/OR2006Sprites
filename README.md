# Contributions welcome!

A repository hosting all sprites that have been ripped from the various Outrun 2[006] versions, as well as any HD UI remakes and texture mods. Asset replacements are intended to be used with [OutRun2006 Tweaks.](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/)

## Official Media Kit Assets
Contains some HQ cars, logos, and various other images of note.

## Original _____
Contains texture dumps from different versions of Outrun 2. The PC folder contains a separate subfolder for [or2tool](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/90) alongside Tweaks' own internal texture dump folder. Since Tweaks only dumps what is loaded by the game, or2tool is included here to catch any unused files (such as alternate girlfriend colors).

## PSDs
Contains any PSD files that were shared.

## Remake
Contains HD asset remakes and miscellanious retexture mods.

## Feeling overwhelmed?
There's quite a bit of mixing and matching to do.

## Special Thanks to Contributors
