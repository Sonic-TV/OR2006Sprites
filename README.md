# Contributions welcome!

A repository hosting all sprites that have been ripped from the various Outrun 2[006] versions, as well as any HD UI remakes and texture mods. Asset replacements are intended to be used with [OutRun2006 Tweaks.](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/)

# Official Media Kit Assets
Contains some HQ cars, logos, and various other images of note.

# Original _____
Contains texture dumps from different versions of Outrun 2. The PC folder contains a separate subfolder for [or2tool](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/90) alongside Tweaks' own internal texture dump folder. Since Tweaks only dumps what is loaded by the game, or2tool is included here to catch any unused files (such as alternate girlfriend colors).

# PSDs
Contains any PSD files that were shared.

# Remake
Contains HD asset remakes and miscellanious retexture mods. Note that WIP contains placeholder AI upscale assets, so use those at your own risk or wait until they're complete.

## Textures/Sprites

### [UI](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/)

#### [Album Covers](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Album%20Covers/)
Contains HD remakes of the music albums.

#### [Controller Prompts](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Button%20Prompts)
Contains various replacement textures for the keyboard prompt icons.

#### [Font](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Font)
Contains HD versions of the various menu fonts.

#### [Menus](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/UI/Menus)
Contains HD versions of the various menu sprites.

#### Billboards
In the [Billboards](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Billboards/) folder, you'll find two folders. **Invisible Billboards**, for if you want to completely remove the billboards altogether, and **SEGA Billboards (Habanero)** for some fan-made SEGA billboards. You can leave **Invisible Billboards** in the `/load/` folder, since the game reuses the same billboards for multiple levels. **SEGA Billboards** was designed with giving each billboard a unique image, so you should put those in the respective folder of the level whose billboard you want to replace. You can download a dump of all the billboards sorted into their level folders [here](https://github.com/ksdomino/or2billboards/releases), with a level folder name table included.

#### Invisible Road Signs
In the [Road Signs](/Remakes%20and%20Reskins/Levels/Invisible%20Road%20Signs/) folder, you'll find a texture replacement zip that makes all road signs invisible. Aside from reducing visual clutter and making the stages look nicer, this also provides a bit of extra challenge so you have to memorize the stage rather than using the road signs as a crutch.

#### HD Drivers' Licenses
As of this [version of Tweaks](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/actions/runs/10657217498), you can now change your character to Sam, Wolf, or Alberto (all of the girlfriends don't render properly in-game as drivers). `Remakes and Reskins/UI/Menus/spr_sprani_sumo_fe_cvt_Exst/D2065DF6_256x256.dds` contains an HD remake of the license menu.
