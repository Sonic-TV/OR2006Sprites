# What is it?

This compilation is for anyone who just found out about **Outrun2006-Tweaks** and the higher resolution textures but are confused with so many files and configurations.

The objective is to have a ready-to-use texture pack for the GUI for the game. Download, extract and play.

Should have give the current best results while keeping the game as faithful to the original but with better resolution.

This is a collaborative work in process so it's normal to find some upscaled or pixelated textures. The best will be done to keep the pack updated while the rest of the talented artists keep working on the images.

All files where taken from [Sonic-TV OR2006Sprites repo](https://github.com/Sonic-TV/OR2006Sprites) and [emoose Textures thread](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20).
