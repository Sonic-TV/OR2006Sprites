# What is it?

I decided to make this compilation for anyone who just found out about **Outrun2006-Tweaks** and the higher resolution textures but are confused with so many files and configurations.

The objetive is to have a ready-to-use texture pack for the GUI for the game. Download, extract and play.

Should give the current best results while keeping the game as faithful to the original relesase but with better resolution.

This is a work in prossess so it's normal to find some upscaled or pixelated textures. I'll do my best to keep the pack updated while the rest of the talented artists keep working on the rest.

All files where taken from [Sonic-TV OR2006Sprites repo](https://github.com/Sonic-TV/OR2006Sprites) and [emoose Textures thread](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/20). 

All credits go to the respective authors.

# How to use

1) Install _Outrun 2006: Coast To Coast_ , it's recomended to NOT use `C:\Program Files`

2) Download [Outrun2006Tweaks](https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/releases/)

3) Extract `Outrun2006Tweaks.zip` on your _Outrun 2006: Coast To Coast_ instalation folder.

4) On the newly created `OutRun2006Tweaks.ini` configurations file make sure you have the following lines:

`UITextureReplacement = true`

`RestoreJPClarissa = true`

5) Extract the ZIP file in your  _Outrun 2006: Coast To Coast_ instalation folder. 

There should now be a `textures/load` directory with several `spr_*` folders with `*.dds` texture files.
