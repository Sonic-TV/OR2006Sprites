These are WIP so I might replace one later.

These are made in Stable Diffusion 1.5 via Easy Diffusion with the DPM Solver (Stability AI) sampler and tiled enabled. Don't upscale, since that produces seams along the tile edges. Find a seed you like at x512, and then render it at your desired resolution.
