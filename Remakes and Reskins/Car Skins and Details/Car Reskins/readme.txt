Reference the color chart for the vanilla car colors (top row is Xbox (note the lack of transparency), second row is PC.

The PSD included is a basic livery aligned for the 288 GTO and looks like this (https://i.imgur.com/C4kIE1z.png). Swap the colors to your favorite color scheme.

recolors go in obj_pc_color_pmt.txt and are shared amongst all cars, so when making a color scheme/livery, it is advised that you pick one car and design solely for that since the other car skins will get messed up (they all have different mapping for textures)

Outrun details such as stripes go in their respective folder
